# Spell Checker
A CLI Java App to Check for Spell Errors and Present Word Suggestions

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a command-line application, written in Java, that interprets user word input, validates it, detects spelling errors and presents word suggestions to fix them.

To do this, we first implemented and tested a Bloom Filter and wrote functions for hash Murmur, Minhash and LSH.
Then, the SpellChecker application was developed, using the Bloom Filter to check if input words appear on the system's dictionaries and the Minhash and LSH to present alternative words when no matches are found based on string similarity.
